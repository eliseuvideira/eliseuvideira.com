The <code>Array.from</code> function is pretty useful to convert array like structures in a proper array, 
I think the most used case is converting a list of HTML elements to array.

Take this example:

```js
const titleElements = document.querySelectorAll('h1');

const titles = Array.from(titleElements).map(element => element.textContent);
```

This example extracts the content of <code>h1</code> tags from a html page.

That's nice, but there's a way to improve this code by making use of a lesser known feature, the callback we can pass to <code>Array.from</code>
allow us to change the content of each element in the soon to be array, the same thing the <code>map</code> method is doing.

This is a rewrite of the previous snippet

```js
const titleElements = document.querySelectorAll('h1');

const titles = Array.from(titleElements, element => element.textContent);
```

Now we eliminated the need for <code>.map</code>, since <code>Array.from</code> alone accomplishes the same desired output.

We can also replace <code>.map</code> access in an array for <code>Array.from</code>.

Take this example, you have an array of cart products and want to find out the most expensive price in the list

```js
const products = [
  {
    productId: 3604356263131261,
    productName: 'Desk',
    productPrice: 413.2,
  },
  {
    productId: 5445735849133131,
    productName: 'Chair',
    productPrice: 253.17,
  },
  .
  .
  .
];

const mostExpensive = Math.max(
  ...products.map(product => product.productPrice),
);

console.log(mostExpensive);
```

In this example we create a new array with the prices, and then destructure it and pass to the Math.max function, to get the highest price.

We can do pretty much the same using <code>Array.from</code>.

```js
const mostExpensive = Math.max(
  ...Array.from(products, product => product.productPrice),
);

console.log(mostExpensive);
```

The callback for both <code>Array.from</code> and <code>Array.prototype.map</code> is pretty similar, 
except that you don't get access to the full array in the <code>Array.from</code>.

We can verify this by logging the parameters received.

```js
// Array.prototype.map
products.map((...args) => console.log(args));

// Array.from
Array.from(products, (...args) => console.log(args));
```

The <code>Array.prototype.map</code> one will receive three parameters, the current item, the index and the full array.
The <code>Array.from</code> callback has no access to the full array.

That's it, remember to make use of the <code>Array.from</code> callback from now on.
